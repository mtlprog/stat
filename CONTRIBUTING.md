# Contributing to Stat

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Stat! This document provides guidelines for contributing to the project.

## Reporting Issues

Before creating an issue, please:

1. Search existing issues to avoid duplicates
2. Use a clear, descriptive title
3. Include steps to reproduce the problem
4. Describe expected vs actual behavior
5. Include relevant logs or screenshots

## Submitting Pull Requests

### Before You Start

1. Open an issue to discuss significant changes before implementing
2. Fork the repository and create a branch from `master`
3. Keep PRs focused on a single change

### Code Style

This project follows standard Go conventions:

```bash
# Format code
go fmt ./...

# Run linter
go vet ./...
```

Additional guidelines:
- Keep functions focused and small
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add comments only where logic isn't self-evident
- Avoid over-engineering — solve the problem at hand

### Commit Messages

Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format:

```
<type>: <description>

[optional body]
```

Types:
- `feat:` — New feature
- `fix:` — Bug fix
- `refactor:` — Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `docs:` — Documentation only
- `chore:` — Maintenance tasks
- `test:` — Adding or updating tests

### Testing

Run tests before submitting:

```bash
go test ./...
```

For changes to handlers or services:
- Add or update unit tests

- Follow existing test patterns in the codebase

### Pull Request Process

1. Ensure all tests pass
