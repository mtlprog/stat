# Code of Ethics

## History

This document was inspired by the [SQLite Code of Ethics](https://sqlite.org/codeofethics.html). Like that project, we found that existing codes of conduct often focus on what participants cannot do, creating an adversarial atmosphere. We wanted something different — a document that describes who we aspire to be, not merely what we promise to avoid.

The Rule of St. Benedict has guided communities for over 1,500 years. Chapter 4, "The Tools of Good Works," provides 74 principles for living a virtuous life. These principles emphasize personal responsibility, respect for others, humility, and service — qualities that make for good software developers and good community members.

## Purpose

This code of ethics is a personal commitment by the developers of this project. It is a statement of our values and aspirations. It is not a legal document and creates no obligations for anyone.

**This code is entirely one-directional.** It applies only to project contributors. Users of the software are not bound by this code in any way. You do not have to agree with our ethics to use our software. The software is provided under the MIT license, with no ethical strings attached.

No one is required to follow these principles to contribute. They represent an ideal we strive toward, not a requirement we enforce. We recognize that reasonable people may disagree about ethics, and we welcome contributors regardless of their personal beliefs.

59. Amend those sins for the future.
60. Do not fulfill the desires of the flesh.
61. Hate your own will.
62. Obey in all things the commands of those placed over you, even if they themselves act otherwise. Be mindful of the Lord's precept: Do what they say, but not what they do.
63. Do not wish to be called holy before you are so, but first be holy that you may be truly called so.

74. Never despair of God's mercy.

These are the tools of the spiritual craft. When we have used them without ceasing day and night, and have returned them on judgment day, our wages will be the reward the Lord has promised: *What the eye has not seen nor the ear heard, God has prepared for those who love Him.*
